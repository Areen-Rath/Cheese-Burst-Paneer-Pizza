# Recipe:
* Take the pizza base. If you are using Maida, make a dough of it, make a ball from the dough and roll it, but it should be a bit thicker than the  size you use for Puri.
* Take Mozzarella cheese cuboid, grate it and put it on the pizza base. Since it is a cheese burst, put more amount of cheese. If you are using Maida, a suggestion is to put the grated cheese on top of the base and cover it with another layer of Maida. After that, again add cheese.
* Add all the toppings on the pizza base.
* Now bake the pizza in an oven, otherwise use a Tava to cook it.
* Finally add the oregano and chilli flakes.
Tadaaa... Your pizza is ready!!! Enjoy the delicacy.
